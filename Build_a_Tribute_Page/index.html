			<h4><strong>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</strong></h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>

				<li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
				<li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.</li>
				<li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
				<li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer.</li>
				<li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation</li>
				<li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
				<li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
				<li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
				<li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
				<li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95</li>
